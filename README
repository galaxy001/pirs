1 Introduction
==============
    pIRS is a program for simulating Illumina PE reads, with a series of characters generated by 
  Illumina sequencing platform, such as insert size distribution, sequencing error, quality score 
  and GC content-coverage bias. 
    As all know, the insert size follows a normal distribution, so users should set the mean value 
  and standard deviation. We usually set the standard deviation as 1/20 of the mean value. We 
  simulate the normal distribution by Box-Muller method. 
    The program simulates sequencing error, quality score and GC content-coverage bias according 
  to the empirical distribution profile. We provide some default profiles counted from lots of real 
  sequencing data.
    To simulate reads from diploid genome, users should simulate the diploid genome sequence firstly 
  by setting the ratio of heterozygosis SNP, heterozygosis InDel and structure variation. 

2 Program framework
===================
  2.1 Profile Generator
    Six tools are supplied. SOAP2 or BWA, soap.coverage (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapaligner.html) 
  are required. The full process is shown in getprofile.sh.example as an example.
    2.1.1 GC%-Depth Profile Stat.
      a). Run soap and soap.coverage to get .depth single file(s). gzip is OK to over it.
      b). Run gc_coverage_bias on all depth single files. You will get gc-depth stat by 1 GC% and other files.
      c). Run gc_coverage_bias_plot on the gc-depth stat file. You'll get PNG plot and a .gc file by 5 GC%.
      d). Manually check the .gc file for any abnormal levels due to the lower depth on certain GC% windows.
    2.1.2 Base-Calling Profile Stat:
      a). Run soap or bwa to get .{soap,single} or .sam file(s).
      b). Run error_matrix_calculator on those file(s). You will get *.{count,ratio}.matrix .
      c). You can use error_matrix_merger to merge several .{count,ratio}.matrix files.
         However, it is up to you to keep the read length matches.
    2.1.3 InDel Profile Stat:
      a). Choose samples with NO polymorphism InDel, such as the Coliphage samples that shipped with Illumina Sequencers.
      b). Run bwa to get .sam/.bam file.
      c). Run indelstat_sam_bam to get the profile.
    2.1.4 Insert size & mapping ratio stat:
      a). Run soap or bwa to get .{soap,single} or .sam file(s).
      b). Run alignment_stator *.
         * alignment_stator cannot stat. mapping ratio for sam files now.
  2.2 Simulator
    Two commands:
    pirs diploid: use for generating diploid genome sequence. Read the input genome sequence and 
                  then simulate SNP, InDel, SV(structure variation) on it. At last, output the 
                  result genome sequence.
    pirs simulate: use for simulating Illumina data, output PE-read file.
    Note:
      a) If you only want to simulate the diploid genome sequence, "pirs diploid" is enough.
      b) If you want to simulate sequencing data of haploid genome, only you need is "pirs simulate".
      c) If you want to simulate sequencing data of diploid genome, you first need to run "pirs diploid" 
         to get the other diploid genome sequence, and then run "pirs simulate" using both the original 
         genome sequence and the previous output sequence as the input.

6 Note
======
  a) When simulating InDel in genome: they go halves on the total rate respectively, 1~6bp bases as the number 
  of InDel, and the rate distribution of each type as below: 1bp-64.82%, 2bp-17.17%, 3bp-7.20%, 4bp-7.29%, 5bp-2.18%, 
  6bp-1.34%, which is the empirical distribution from panda re-sequencing data, we can set the total InDel rate with 
  option -d. When simulating SV (structural variation): insertion, deletion and invertion, each of them share 1/3 of 
  total rate, here we use this rate distribution for simplicity: 100bp-70%, 200bp-20%, 500bp-7%, 1000bp-2%, 2000bp-1%, 
  we can set the total SV rate with option -v.
  b) Program do not simulate reads contain "N" char. If the input reference contains "N" char, reads which generated 
  in this region will be discarded.
  c) The allowed max length of read depends on the cycle number of Base-calling profile. User should set read length 
  less than half of cycle number.
  d) The program parses one chromosome at a time, so dose the output. In diploid mode, each reference file  is sampled 
  with half depth.
  e) Random-seed in this program is set with system time, so when you need to simulate data in batches,it needs a 
  interval for each task(such as one second).
